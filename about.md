## Other facts about me
I'm currently living in San Jose, California with my lovely wife Vy and adorable mini goldendoodle [Yuna](/assets/img/yuna-chan.jpeg). We like to go on walks and do other outdoor activities like running, hiking and biking.

I'm also an amateur practitioner of mindfulness and follow the [Plum Village](https://plumvillage.org)  meditation teachings.

I've run a half marathon in [2019]({% post_url 2019-07-28-42nd-biofreeze-sf-marathon-1st-half %}), [2022]({% post_url 2022-11-06-2022-rock-n-roll-san-jose-half-marathon %}) and preparing to do another one with my wife this year 2023.

I am considerate of people and would like to be treated the same.

## Some info about this blog
I spent quite a bit of time trying to make up my mind what should be on this blog homepage - whether it should be info about myself or the notes that I wrote. Ultimately I decided to show the articles because it is not about me but my contents.

I do not have a specific theme of topics that are covered in this blog. Mainly what I want to share revolves around my work, life and interests.
If you expect a lot of randomness, this blog is for you.

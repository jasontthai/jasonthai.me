![August](/assets/img/month-of-august.jpg)

This month has been busy. I have been learning more about self-hosting software and doing some tinkering with them.

Currently I am checking out these 2 subreddits: 
* [https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted](https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted)
* [https://reddit.com/r/homelab](https://reddit.com/r/homelab)

These subs give me some motivation of creating my home server to store data and share with families and friends. But that will be the next step as I am using a cloud provider to do my hosting.

What I am hosting:
* [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - Opensource password manager. I decided to delete my Lastpass's account and use a self-hosted Bitwarden instance to manage my passwords. So far so good. I keep my data.
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) - Productivity platform (Gsuite replacement). I use this to sync my files across computers. The platform offers a lot more than just file syncing. I haven't explored much but it looks promising. Another file syncing alternative is [Seafile](https://seafile.com) which people say is more reliable.
* [Plex](https://plex.tv) - Media organizer. I am also exploring hosting my media so I can view them everywhere. Another popular alternative is [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) 
* [TT-RSS](https://tt-rss.org) - RSS feeds
* [Firefly-III](https://firefly-iii.org/) - Budget app. I am also trying out this budget app. It is quite different from my [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) and needs taking used too. So far I am more pleased with the latter one.

If you want to try out these services, let me know and I can give you access to them.

Moving on...
I am still reading about finance this month. They are easy to understand and are a nice complement to the ones I read in July. I highly recommend these books.

Finally the biggest news, I am moving this upcoming September! I have been living at my current place for over four years. It suits well for a bachelor who is living alone. Now Vy is here with me, I want us to live someplace bigger and more comfortable. So it is exciting to move yet it is a little bit bittersweet as the current landlords are very nice people. Anyway, looking forward to the new place!

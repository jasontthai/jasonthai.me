I've walked the paths many have walked.  
I'm solving problems many people have solved.  
I'm living in a house a few people have called home.  


I do not grow the food I eat  
Or make the clothes I wear  
The technology that I use is invented by someone.


I once knew some people whose names I no longer remember.  
I once knew some people who no longer exist.  
I know some people with whom I've lost touch.  
I know some people who no longer remember me.  
I know some people that I'm hesitant to talk to.  
Every now and then, I think of them and wonder if anyone still thinks of me.  


There was once a large tree in front of my house.   
It was much older than I am.  
It is no longer here.  
I think about it every now and then.  
There is now a new baby tree to replace the old one.  
It's a bit tilted but I'm hoping it will grow strong just like its distant cousin.


I borrow a lot from nature  
Things such as air, water, and light.  
But I have not given much back to it yet  
How long can I take these for granted  
Before everything is taken away from me?

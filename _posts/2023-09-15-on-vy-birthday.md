Another year means another piece of poetry for you. I hope you enjoy this piece. On your birthday, I just want to say I'm grateful for your being with me, for who you are, and for the thoughts that you have shared with me. I'm lucky to be the one to listen to your stories, to be able to laugh along your side, and also to be able to see the tears from your eyes. There's something that I'd like you to do starting now. That is to foster your inner child, to be able to grow inward and be in touch with your emotions. I hope you and I can do some soul-searching together and that we can become kids again!

A poem for your birthday  

There once was a time  
You and I were strangers  
Some time passed by  
Friends we became  
A little more time went by  
Lover we called each other  
I ask myself  
When enough time goes by  
What will we be?  

You are there  
When I stumble and crumble  
When I trip and fall  
When I laugh and smile  
When I'm hurt and cry  
For that I thank you  
For standing by me  
For tagging along  
The journey I'm on.  

There once was a time  
You and I were strangers  
and did not know much  
about who we were  
But now here we are  
Being next to each other  
And I ask myself  
What else could matter?

I finally ran my first half marathon today 07-28-19 in the [Biofreeze SF Marathon](https://www.thesfmarathon.com/). This has been one of my goals of the year. Suffice to say it has been one of the best day of my life so far. Here is the result of my race:

Some other stats about my training journey:
* Training duration: 8 weeks
* Number of running hours: 24
* Number of miles: 145 

From not being able to run much from February this year, it has been a good journey so far. Ever since I found out about [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/39726096), it has been the source of motivation to get me running. There are a lot of runners out there and seeing how they push themselves everyday to run harder and faster is truly wonderful. I am glad to join the running club and hoping to continue for a long time. Also thank you to my friend Tri Hoang for pushing me, it is good to have a running buddy.

If you want to get started in running, I suggest checking out [Couch 2 5K Program](https://www.c25k.com/). This will help guide you along the way from not running to your first 5K. Get out there and start running!

I ran with my coworkers J. and E. today and E. brought up this conversation once he saw a bird flying ahead of us. He pointed at it and said that if he were to be reincarnated, he would be that. But not just any kind of bird, it has to be a predator so he can't be easily hunted. I want to make sure I know the reason so I asked why he thought so and he said so he can fly. I said I would probably be a pet, specifically a dog that is raised in a good family so I can be pampered and taken care of. J. mentioned he would be a cat so he can stay close to humans. I think he wanted to be human still, but since we said humans don't count, he quickly gave that answer. I told E. that Vy would like to be a wild flower and he was so surprised by that answer. I jokingly said that I told Vy to be beware of the dogs that would pee on her when they pass by. One of them could be me. We were running under a hot sun and everyone was tired but I enjoyed this conversation a lot. It brought out the inner kid within us. I'm not sure they felt the same but that's how I did. Just a few guys, who are presumably adults, discussing something so unrelated to work. Just writing about it makes me smile.

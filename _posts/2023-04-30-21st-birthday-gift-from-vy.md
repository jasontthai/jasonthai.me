Vy found this piece of memento the other day while driving back from LA. I admitted I forgot about it and was pleasantly surprised when she brought it up. We listened to the curated playlist that she created when writing this letter for me. I was flushed with a mix of emotions - excitement, nostalgia, and a sense of anticipation for the future. We weren't together back then, but I remember feeling anxious when I received her email. Listening to these songs again after all these years, I realized how lucky I am to have Vy in my life. We have been through many ups and downs, and she has always been my rock, steady and down to earth, the support that I need, and my confidante. Her words gave me the strength and motivation to face life's challenges with determination and zeal.

It has been a long since that day, but sitting beside her and harmonizing the songs with her fills me with warmth and gratitude. I'm blessed by her love for me. I'm pasting the content of the letter below as a reminder of what she has done for me.

**Once upon a time …**<br>
We have met for seven years<br>
How did we at such a young age<br>
Meet each other, I don’t even remember how<br>

**I’m lucky I'm in love with my best friend**<br>
Lucky to have been where I have been<br>

**However …**<br>
Can't swallow our pride<br>
Neither of us wanna raise that flag<br>
If we can't surrender then we both gonna lose<br>

I'm divided in two. Please tell me what should I do?<br>
A part of me says no no no no, and another runs to you<br>

**However …**<br>
If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?<br>
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?<br>
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?<br>

**They said,**<br>
"I bet they'll never make it"<br>
But just look at us holding on<br>
We're still together still going strong<br>

But I know you're here with me now<br>

**And then …**<br>
You're half a world away<br>

So far away I can hardly make you mine<br>
So long the day you are always on my mind<br>

The silence isn't so bad<br>
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad<br>
'Cause the spaces between my fingers<br>
Are right where yours fit perfectly<br>

**Time passed,**<br>
It gave me a simple yearning<br>
Different from what my mind was seeing<br>

I feel your whisper across the sea<br>

During those 3 years spent alone<br>
We contacted each other sometimes<br>
Even if I met someone else again<br>
Even I loved again …<br>

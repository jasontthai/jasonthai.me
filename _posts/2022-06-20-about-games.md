I love to game but lately I haven't been able to find the time. I think Elden Ring is one of the popular games nowadays. I also heard Final Fantasy VII Remake is now available for PC.
The only gaming console I have is the Nintendo Switch which has been left untouched for sometimes. I am keen on the PS5 but I don't think I'll be able to spend too much time on it. Anyway I feel a bit old
when I mention about this topic. On the plus side, I have more time to spend on other things that I enjoy but gaming has an important place in my heart nonetheless.

Here is a list of games that I'm interested in. Hopefully I get to spend some of my time on them in the future:
* [Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring)
* [Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade](https://ffvii-remake-intergrade.square-enix-games.com/)
* [Grow: Song of the Evertree](https://growsongoftheevertree.com/)

These will have to wait but our paths will cross my games (eventually).

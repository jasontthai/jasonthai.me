description: Summary of what's been happening in September 2019

Vy finally came back after doing internship in Hanoi. It has a brief yet long 3 months for us. We also moved in the new apartment and although it took a while, we reached to a point where everything was set up. We bought a new dining table, 2 chairs, a new bed and some other kitchen items. We did a lot of things together for the first time too like baking. Vy and I managed to successfully bake a coffee cake. We also decided to eat at home more and I started cooking a bit.

We spent quite a bit of money during this month as the cost of moving and buying things for the new place. As a result, I skipped one cycle of investing. Hopefully this will resume this coming month of October.

I did not run so much in September and my legs are getting itchy. Hopefully I'll run again soon in the new area.

This upcoming month of October is the [Cybersecurity Awareness Month](https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month), please spend sometime going over your online presence, updating your passwords. That's all folks.

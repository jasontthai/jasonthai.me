I value simplicity, not complexity. That's probably why I've been running for a few years. Running is one of the simplest activities anyone can do. Unlike other sports, it requires very little - a pair of shoes, a set of clothes, and an open space. Then you put one foot in front of the other, and repeat. It's wonderfully simple.

People sometimes confuse simple with easy, perhaps because simple and easy don't sound very impressive or challenging. When you actually do it, day in and day out, you'll probably feel the difference between simple and easy. Anyone who runs seriously knows that it's a demanding sport. From slow runs to fast runs. From the burning sensation in your lungs as you push the pace. From the heaviness in your legs after many long miles. It's not easy at all.

And there is the mental aspect. Runners need discipline to stick to their training plan. They have to fight the internal battle of putting on their shoes in the early morning or after a tiring day at work, when the weather is not favorable. They need to overcome the confusion in their minds when their bodies want to stop. It is not easy.

Day by day, month by month, year by year, mile by mile, the simple process becomes a challenging process. Unlike sports that emphasize beating the opponent, running is a personal battle. Are we better than we were yesterday, surpassing the records we have created. In this personal journey, every run, every effort, whether it helps us achieve a new achievement or just puts on our shoes and walks out the door, is a victory worth celebrating.
